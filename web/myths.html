                    You’ll explode if you go into space without a suit on</p>

                <p>It’s a commonly peddled myth, especially in old science fiction movies, but it’s actually completely
                    false.</p>

                <p>The nitrogen in your body would expand and you’d bloat severely, and you'd eventually die.</p>

                <p>However, your skin is far too tough to let everything explode out of it.</p>

                <p class="bigText">Shooting stars are stars</p>

                <p>If you have ever wished upon a star, you may be shocked to learn it wasn’t a star at all.</p>

                <p>The idea that shooting stars are literally stars streaking across the sky might be one of the most
                    popular of all myths in astronomy.</p>

                <p>When you see a shooting star, you're actually witnessing the bright flare of piece of debris, likely
                    to be no bigger than a grain of sand, burning up in our atmosphere.</p>

                <p>They are properly known as meteors. If a fragment makes it to Earth’s surface, it is called a
                    meteorite.</p>

                <p class="bigText">There’s a dark side of the moon</p>
                <p>There is a side of the Moon that, from Earth, we can never see. This much is true.</p>

                <p>However, it’s a complete myth that it is in complete darkness all the time.</p>

                <p>The Moon has daytime and night-time just as the Earth does, though each lasts two weeks, so both
                    sides get sunlight at some point. </p>

                <p>The reason it’s been historically called the ‘dark side’ is because it’s mysterious, and until
                    recently, not much was known about it. This year, China launched a probe to explore the far side of
                    the Moon, to learn more. </p>

                <p>However, the first images of the far side of the moon were taken in 1959.</p>

                <p class="bigText">They didn’t put us here</p>

                <p>A popular fringe theory holds that humans are alien's gift to Earth.</p>

                <p>Some people say we were delivered here during a near pass to Earth of a life-bearing planet called
                    Nibiru.</p>

                <p>This alleged planet, which has not actually been observed by astronomers, is said to skirt the edges
                    of the solar system and swing inward from time to time</p>

                <p class="bigText">They’re immune to Earth’s bacteria</p>

                <p>Alien visitors to Earth are occasionally depicted in science fiction as being brought down by their
                    own alien nature. Lacking immunity to Earth-based bacteria, they all die of infections.</p>

                <p>This wouldn't really happen. "Alien life forms wouldn't come here only to be done in by our bacteria,
                    unless they were related biochemically to humans," Shostak told IEEE Spectrum. "
                </p>

                <p>Bacteria would have to be able to interact with their biochemistry to be dangerous, and their ability
                    to do that is far from a sure thing."</p>
